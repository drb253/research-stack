# Environment Life Review Forge

Use this skill for environmental, ecological, biomedical, and life-science systematic reviews where exposure, organism/population, outcome, context, and study design need careful domain adaptation.

## Core Principle

Domain structure matters. The same effect-size workflow may be misleading if exposure windows, species, tissues, endpoints, geography, or measurement platforms are not comparable.

## Intake

Identify:

- domain: environment, ecology, toxicology, epidemiology, life science, molecular biology, public health;
- framework: PECO or PICO;
- population or organism;
- exposure or intervention;
- comparator;
- outcomes/endpoints;
- study design;
- spatial and temporal scale;
- ecosystem-service set, pairwise relationship definition, synergy/trade-off coding, and threshold-management target, if ecosystem-service relationships are in scope;
- pollutant exposure, crop outcome, food-security endpoint, counterfactual air-quality target, and crop-calorie translation, if air-quality food-security modeling is in scope;
- biodiversity dimension, stability metric, climate-stress gradient, and moderation/interaction target, if biodiversity-stability evidence is in scope;
- spatial unit and aggregation boundary, if geospatial prediction is in scope;
- minimum mapping unit and detection threshold, if small-patch systems are in scope;
- target map variable, spatial resolution, observation inventory, predictor stack, spatial autocorrelation plan, and uncertainty layer, if an environmental map product is in scope;
- measurement method;
- bidirectional pathways, if impacts and feedbacks are both in scope;
- expected heterogeneity.

## Guardrails

- Do not pool across species, exposure windows, or outcome constructs without a biological or environmental rationale.
- Do not collapse mechanistic, observational, and experimental evidence without design labels.
- Do not hide geography, climate zone, tissue type, or measurement platform when they drive heterogeneity.
- Do not treat PLS VIP rankings as causal drivers of an environmental outcome; VIP is a model-dependent predictive summary under a chosen component count and scaling.
- Do not interpret PLS/VIP without component-selection, cross-validation, coefficient direction, and residual checks.
- Do not treat ESR thresholds from PDP, SHAP, ALE, or response curves as causal ecological tipping points without experimental, quasi-experimental, mechanistic, or temporal evidence.
- Do not translate model-derived optimal intervals into zoning rules without auditing spatial leakage, resolution, service-model uncertainty, threshold uncertainty, and local feasibility.
- Do not treat air-quality food-security counterfactuals as realized production gains without checking crop area, weather, management, prices, imports, storage, and policy implementation.
- Do not treat SIF or remote-sensing productivity proxies as yield unless crop-specific validation and conversion logic are explicit.
- Do not claim soil biodiversity stabilizes ecosystems under aridity without defining the stability metric, stress gradient, temporal scale, spatial dependence, and possible productivity confounding.
- Do not interpret biodiversity-stability moderation as causal unless the design supports causal identification or experimental manipulation.
- Do not flatten soil-fauna effects into one "carbon benefit" or "carbon cost" label when stock and flux outcomes move in different directions.
- Do not treat coarse-resolution wetland products as scale neutral; audit which small features are omitted.
- Do not treat a geospatial environmental map as ground truth; audit observation density, spatial autocorrelation, permafrost or domain masks, predictor time windows, uncertainty layers, and extrapolation zones.
- Do not compare cryosphere maps across products or periods without checking target definition, depth convention, permafrost boundary, resolution, map vintage, and uncertainty.
- Do not compare methane budgets without checking double-counting between wetlands, lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and inundated vegetation.
- Do not turn methane emissions alone into a wetland management recommendation without carbon storage, biodiversity, hydrology, and ecosystem-service trade-offs.
- Do not use vote-counting as evidence of effect direction or strength.
- Do not treat SHAP, feature importance, PDP, or AutoML performance as causal evidence without a separate identification strategy.
- Do not call DML or CATE estimates causal unless treatment timing, confounder adjustment, overlap, and hidden-confounding risks are explicit.
- Do not treat DML as a generic prediction method; it estimates causal parameters only under stated identification assumptions.
- Do not treat spatial DML as solved by adding coordinates; audit spatial dependence, spillovers, clustered inference, and validation boundaries.
- Do not interpret short-term yield gains as soil-carbon sequestration evidence without duration, baseline SOC, depth, and measurement-method checks.
- Do not collapse fertilizer form, nutrient rate, baseline nutrient limitation, crop type, and climate into one pooled effect without moderator or subgroup logic.
- Do not describe food-system impacts in only one direction when the review question is bidirectional; map both pressure and feedback pathways.
- Do not treat global average food footprints as local risk without tracing trade, geography, vulnerability, and production-system context.
- Do not treat county-level predicted food waste as directly collectible waste without collection participation, contamination, hauling cost, facility capacity, and policy constraints.
- Do not ignore spatial autocorrelation, adjacency leakage, urban-rural imbalance, or high-waste outliers when auditing geospatial ML forecasts.
- Do not interpret store counts, restaurant counts, population, income, or social-program access as causal drivers unless the design supports causal inference.
- Do not treat random train/test performance in crop trials as proof of generalization to new years, sites, or genotypes; require grouped or out-of-domain validation where the claim needs it.
- Do not interpret variable importance, PDPs, or SHAP values causally unless the design supports causal interpretation.
- Do not present future yield forecasts without explicit weather/climate inputs, scenario assumptions, and extrapolation checks.
- Do not treat a machine-learning scenario projection as causal proof unless the design supports causal interpretation.
- Do not present a policy lever, such as recycling rate or intervention coverage, as sufficient without auditing implementation quality and compensating inputs.
- Do not treat a Pareto-efficient frontier as a politically feasible pathway without social, economic, governance, biodiversity, and transition-cost constraints.
- Do not collapse global objective gains into local welfare claims without regional supply, trade, livelihood, water-access, and justice checks.
- Do not generalize an irrigation salinity decision range across regions without soil texture, groundwater depth, climate, crop variety, irrigation method, and long-term salt-balance checks.
